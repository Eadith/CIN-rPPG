# CIN-rPPG
A rPPG estimation method.
The code for CIN-rPPG will update soon.

This is a simple case for visualizing the real-time performance. We test a video sequence with 150 frames on GPU RTX3090, the CIN-rPPG model costs 35ms for inference, and for CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core, the inference time is 148ms. From the inference time, the CIN-rPPG can achieve quasi-real-time performance. The inference video is below.
